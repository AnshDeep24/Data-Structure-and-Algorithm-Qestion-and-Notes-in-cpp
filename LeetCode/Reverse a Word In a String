Reverse Words in a String
Problem Statement: Given a string s, reverse the words of the string.

Examples:

Example 1:
Input: s=”this is an amazing program”
Output: “program amazing an is this”

Example 2:
Input: s=”This is decent”
Output: “decent is This”
Solution:

Disclaimer: Don’t jump directly to the solution, try it out yourself first.

Solution 1(Brute Force)
Intuition: We just need to print the words in reverse order. Can we somehow store them in reverse order of the occurrence and then simply add it to our answer?

Approach
Use a stack to push all the words in a stack
Now, all the words of the string are present in the stack, but in reverse order
Pop elements of the stack one by one and add them to our answer variable. Remember to add a space between the words as well. 
Here’s a quick demonstration of the same

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    string s="TUF is great for interview preparation";
    cout<<"Before reversing words: "<<endl;
    cout<<s<<endl;
    s+=" ";
    stack<string> st;
    int i;
    string str="";
    for(i=0;i<s.length();i++)
    {
        if(s[i]==' ')
        {
            st.push(str);
            str="";
        }
        else str+=s[i];
    }
    string ans="";
    while(st.size()!=1)
    {
        ans+=st.top()+" ";
        st.pop();
    }
    ans+=st.top();// The last word should'nt have a space after it
    cout<<"After reversing words: "<<endl;
    cout<<ans;
    return 0;
}
